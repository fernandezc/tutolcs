*Laboratoire Catalyse et Spectrochimie - ENSICAEN*

LCS - Materials for the Python tutorials
========================

1) install the **Anaconda Scientific Python Distribution**:

* Go to [http://continuum.io/downloads](http://continuum.io/downloads) and follow the instructions for your platform - and if you register as academic member of the university you get interesting add-ons

or 2) install the **Canopy Enthought Distribution** (*This is the distribution I use myself*):

* Go to https://store.enthought.com  (it's a commercial distribution, but you have a free version Canopy Express - and if you register with your academic email, you can get the full academic version)


Download the [zip](https://github.com/fernandezc/tutolcs/archive/master.zip) (or better *clone* the repository)
